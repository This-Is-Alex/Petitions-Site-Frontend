# Petitions Site
A university assignment requires version control be used, and what better than to make this a publicly available repository to promote open source?

# What is this project?
This is the frontend implementation for a site with similar functionality to change.org

# How do I run this project?
Assuming you have a running backend which matches the URL in src/utils/requests.js (pending to move to a .env file) then you can run `npm run dev` in a terminal to build the vue frontend and run it locally so you can view it in your browser

# A backend, you say?
Yes there is a backend implementation. You can see the API spec for it in API.yml, however the official implementation of the backend this project is with respect to is not my work so I have not uploaded it to this repository to avoid infringing on copyright.
